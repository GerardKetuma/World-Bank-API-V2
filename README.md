## World Bank API using Laravel 4

This is the 2nd version of the world bank API to make the routes more user friendly. The new routes will not use Ids for arguments but instead use common names for the countries.

Several routes have been added to expose some data in JSON format. This gives a starting point in creating RESTful APIs in Laravel 4. I will be adding Validations to the tutorial soon.
